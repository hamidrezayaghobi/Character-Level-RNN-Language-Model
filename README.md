# Character-Level-RNN-Language-Model

Welcome to the Character-Level RNN Language Model repository! In this project, I've designed and implemented a character-level Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) language model using implemented Beam Search generation. This model is specifically tailored to work with text data at the character level. It's a powerful tool for generating text, predicting the next character in a sequence, and learning the underlying patterns and structures within the text.
